Open bayeselo interface.

Use "readpgn" to read it. TIP: there is no error for missing file, it just reports 0 games read.

Type "elo" to enter elo computation interface.

Set advantage and drawelo to 0.

Compute with "mm".

View ratings with "ratings".

Write to file via "ratings >whatever.txt". Lack of space after the redirect is important.

NOTE: The ratings when I tried it seemed reasonably insensitive to prior. A little bit of standings shuffle
would occur but nothing crazy.
